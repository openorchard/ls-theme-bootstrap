ls-theme-bootstrap

This is a basic theme using the Twitter Bootstrap framework for the Lemonstand ecommerce system.

Currently it is *almost* complete.  It just needs to get a compare list and be thoroughly tested.

The code does need to be cleaned up in some areas.

Using Bootstrap from 2.1.0 Whip currently.
