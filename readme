ls-theme-bootstrap

This is a basic theme using the Twitter Bootstrap framework for the Lemonstand ecommerce system.

Currently at version 1.5.

The code does need to be cleaned up in some areas due to a rush to complete I didn't comment well in some areas (if at all) and also did not apply proper formatting.

Using Bootstrap from 2.1.1.

Demo setup available at http://dev.jonathan.garbee.me for now.
